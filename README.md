# Local UDP Chatroom

This project is now featured in the University of South Carolina Aiken's CSCI A415 (Data Communications and Computer Networks) course as part of its curriculum.

The project is a chat application that operates by transmitting UDP packets across a local area network (LAN). When a user joins the chat room, the client will display a welcome message and the chat history. The server handles multiple clients simultaneously by initiating a new thread for each client connection.
